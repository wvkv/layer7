## What Makes Layer7 Networks Different?

Layer7 Networks is a Germany-based hosting company that operates its own hardware in ISO/IEC 27001 certified data centers across Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, and Paris. Unlike many hosting providers that resell capacity from larger providers, Layer7 owns and operates their infrastructure, giving them greater control over performance and pricing.

The company's name comes from the ISO/OSI model's 7th layer—the application layer—reflecting their technical roots. Founded by programmers with deep networking expertise, Layer7 has built a reputation among tech enthusiasts and developers for offering some of the most competitive cloud server pricing in the European Union.

- Shared CPU resources with spike capacity

**Dedicated Infrastructure (VDS):**
- Best for: Game servers, cryptocurrency mining, Tor nodes, high-demand applications
- CPU Usage: Up to 100% permanently
- Guaranteed dedicated CPU cores
- Higher performance consistency

## Pricing That Actually Makes Sense

Layer7's pricing structure rewards commitment while remaining accessible:

All prices exclude VAT (19% for Germany, varying rates for other EU countries). If you're ordering from outside the EU, you'll save an additional 19% as VAT won't apply.

## Storage Solutions: Where Layer7 Really Shines

One of Layer7's most compelling offerings is their storage capability. You can add up to three additional HDD disks to any cloud server at just **€2 per TB**, making them incredibly competitive for storage-intensive applications.
